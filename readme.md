## Search Addresses by Postcode

A simple application built using TailwindCSS and Vue JS framework, alongside the Postcoder address lookup API.

Type in a postcode into the input field and blur away. The addresses select box will be populated with all of the addresses for that given postcode.

Have a play with this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/nickdavies791/pen/orBzEE?editors=1010). Make sure to get an API key from [Postcoder](https://postcoder.com/) first.
